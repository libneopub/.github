Hey! I'm working on a yet-to-be-named successor to neopub, which can be found here: [libneopub/untitled](https://github.com/libneopub/untitled). It's still an early prototype. If you're interested, do reach out! My contact details can be found on my profile and [personal website](https://roblog.nl).

For now, here's the old README:

# neopub

> **neopub** is a blogging software developed by [RobinBoers](https://indieweb.org/User:Geheimesite.nl). It runs [micro.geheimesite.nl](https://micro.geheimesite.nl) and is written in PHP. It has a built-in micropub endpoint and sends webmentions. neopub is inspired by [neofeed](https://github.com/victoriadrake/neofeed-theme), [publog](https://p83.nl) and [aaronparecki.com](https://aaronparecki.com).
